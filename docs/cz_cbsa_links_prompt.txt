TASK:  Gather download links (or copies) for the data files that let us map U.S. commuting-zones (CZ) to metropolitan areas (CBSA / MSA), so we can aggregate Lightcast vacancy HHIs from CZ to CBSA level.

Please deliver:
1. A short list of working links (HTTP/HTTPS) to each required file.
2. A one-sentence note for each link that states what the file is and why it is trustworthy (e.g., “official USDA ERS”, “OMB delineation list”, “Census TIGER crosswalk”, etc.).
3. If multiple versions exist, include the most recent and at least one older fallback.

Files we need
A. County → Commuting-Zone cross-walk
   • Typically from the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS).
   • Format: CSV, TXT, or XLSX with at least county FIPS (5-digit) and CZ ID.

B. County → CBSA (metro/micro area) cross-walk
   • Official source is the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) “Delineation Files”, List 1 (CBSA delineations). Released annually.
   • Must include COUNTYFIPS and CBSACode.

(Optional but helpful)
C. County population counts (e.g., 2020 Census) so we can resolve CZs that span multiple CBSAs by picking the CBSA with the largest share.

Search guidance
• Prioritise .gov domains (ers.usda.gov, census.gov, whitehouse.gov/omb).
• Verify that the file formats are open (CSV, TXT, XLSX) and download-able without a login.
• If a direct download link is not obvious, include the web page URL plus instructions on how to find the file.

Output example
```
A. County→CZ
   • https://www.ers.usda.gov/media/9395/county_comuting_zones_2010.xls
     “2010 USDA ERS commuting-zone cross-walk; official – last updated 2015.”

B. County→CBSA
   • https://www2.census.gov/.../list1_2023.xlsx
     “OMB List 1, June 2023 CBSA delineations; official gov file.”

C. County population
   • https://www2.census.gov/.../co-est2020-alldata.csv
     “Census annual county population estimates, 2020.”
```
