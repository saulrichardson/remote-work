# Three-Way Substitution Analysis: Complete Results

## Executive Summary
**Remote work does NOT substitute for geographic expansion.** Remote-enabled firms concentrate MORE in legacy locations, reduce physical expansion, and surprisingly hire FEWER remote workers.

## Key Findings

### 1. IV vs OLS Comparison
- IV estimates are **2.7× larger** than OLS for new MSA effect (-12.1pp vs -4.4pp)
- IV estimates are **2.2× larger** for remote effect (-2.6pp vs -1.2pp)
- This suggests substantial endogeneity bias in OLS estimates
- KP F-statistics > 16 indicate strong instruments

### 2. Consistency Checks ✓
- **Shares sum to zero:** Legacy + New MSA + Remote = 0
  - OLS: 0.0566 + (-0.0444) + (-0.0122) = 0.0000 ✓
  - IV: 0.1473 + (-0.1210) + (-0.0263) = 0.0000 ✓
- **Dispersion = New MSA + Remote:**
  - OLS: -0.0566 = (-0.0444) + (-0.0122) ✓
  - IV: -0.1473 = (-0.1210) + (-0.0263) ✓
- **Legacy = -(New MSA + Remote):**
  - OLS: 0.0566 = -((-0.0444) + (-0.0122)) ✓
  - IV: 0.1473 = -((-0.1210) + (-0.0263)) ✓

### 3. Substitution Analysis

**Expected if remote substitutes for geographic expansion:**
- New MSA: Negative ✓ (confirmed: -12.1pp)
- Remote: Positive ✗ (found: -2.6pp, wrong sign!)
- Total dispersion: Near zero ✗ (found: -14.7pp)

**What we actually found:**
- Remote-enabled firms hire **12.1pp LESS** in new physical locations
- Remote-enabled firms hire **2.6pp LESS** in remote positions (!)
- Remote-enabled firms hire **14.7pp MORE** in legacy offices
- Total geographic dispersion **decreases** by 14.7pp

### 4. Statistical Significance
- New MSA effect: p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- Remote effect: p = 0.082 (marginally significant)
- Total dispersion: p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- Legacy MSA: p < 0.001 (highly significant)

## Interpretation

### The Surprising Result
Remote-enabled firms are **NOT** using remote work to expand geographically. Instead, they are:

1. **Concentrating in legacy hubs** (+14.7pp)
   - Consolidating talent in primary offices
   - Reducing secondary market presence

2. **Reducing physical expansion** (-12.1pp)
   - Fewer new office locations
   - Less geographic diversification

3. **NOT increasing remote hiring** (-2.6pp)
   - Counterintuitive: remote policies don't increase remote hiring
   - Suggests hybrid models centered on existing offices

### Why This Matters
- **Policy implication:** Remote work enables consolidation, not dispersion
- **Strategic insight:** Firms use remote for flexibility within existing footprints
- **Labor market effect:** Benefits concentrated in legacy tech hubs

### Robustness Notes
1. **Pre-period baseline:** Set to theoretical values (legacy=1, new=0, remote=0)
2. **Post-period only:** Collinearity issues prevent separate post-only IV estimation
3. **Full panel preferred:** Uses variation across time for identification

## Data Validation

### Pre-Period (COVID=0)
- N = 24,470 observations
- share_legacy_msa = 1.000 (by construction)
- share_new_msa = 0.000 (by construction)
- share_remote = 0.000 (by construction)
- Total dispersion = 0.000 (by construction)

### Post-Period (COVID=1) 
- N = 17,510 observations
- share_legacy_msa: mean = 0.538, sd = 0.315
- share_new_msa: mean = 0.249, sd = 0.237
- share_remote: mean = 0.213, sd = 0.212
- Total dispersion: mean = 0.462, sd = 0.315

### Treatment Variation (var3 in post-period)
- var3 = 0.0: N=3,759, legacy=49%, new=29%, remote=22%
- var3 = 0.2: N=445, legacy=58%, new=22%, remote=20%
- var3 = 0.4: N=1,780, legacy=55%, new=23%, remote=22%
- var3 = 0.6: N=2,368, legacy=59%, new=21%, remote=21%
- var3 = 0.8: N=270, legacy=58%, new=22%, remote=20%
- var3 = 1.0: N=8,623, legacy=54%, new=25%, remote=21%

## Conclusion

The hypothesis that "remote work enables firms to hire beyond traditional geographic footprints" is **rejected**. 

Instead, remote work appears to enable **geographic consolidation** - firms concentrate MORE in their traditional office locations while reducing both physical expansion to new markets AND remote hiring. This suggests remote work policies are used for workforce flexibility within existing geographic constraints rather than as a tool for geographic expansion.

**Bottom line:** Remote-enabled firms become MORE geographically concentrated, not less.
