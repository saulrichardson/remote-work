Transcript: Smoke test planning session

- Objective: run a trivial end-to-end automation test.
- Please create one task: check out a dedicated branch (suggested name `smoke/orchestrator-test`)
  in a worktree under `worktrees/task-smoke`.
- Inside the repo, add a short note file `docs/orchestrator-smoke.md` stating that the smoke test
  ran successfully. Keep it brief and do not touch other files.
- This task should read `AGENTS.md` before making changes, but no other docs are required.
