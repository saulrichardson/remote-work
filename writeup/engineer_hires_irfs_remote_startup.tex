\section*{Empirical Setup}
We estimate local projections of engineer hiring responses to firm growth. The outcome is a flow scaled by a fixed pre-shock firm size; the regressor is firm headcount growth. We run one regression per horizon $h\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and split results across four groups: Non-Remote/Non-Startup, Remote/Non-Startup, Non-Remote/Startup, and Remote/Startup. Fixed effects are firm and half-year; standard errors cluster by firm.

Projection at horizon $h$:
\begin{equation*}
  y_{f,t+h} \,=\, \beta_h\, g_{f,t} \, + \, \alpha_f \, + \, \tau_t \, + \, \varepsilon_{f,t,h},
\end{equation*}
with definitions
\begin{align*}
  y_{f,t} &\equiv 100\times\frac{\text{Engineer}_{f,t} - \text{Engineer}_{f,t-1}}{\text{Emp}^{\text{pre}}_{f}}, \\
  g_{f,t} &\equiv \texttt{growth\_rate\_we}_{f,t}, \quad \alpha_f:\ \text{firm FE},\ \tau_t:\ \text{half-year FE}.
\end{align*}
Here $\text{Emp}^{\text{pre}}_{f}$ is the firm-specific pre-shock baseline (average 2019 headcount; fallback to first pre-2020 observation). We estimate $\{\beta_h\}^4_{h=0}$ separately within each Remote\,\texttimes\,Startup group.

\paragraph{Plotting.} We present two combined figures per group split: (i) absolute IRFs (levels) and (ii) rebased IRFs (each series shifted so $h{=}0$ is zero) using a shared y-axis for visual comparability across groups.
