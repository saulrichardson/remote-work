# Repository Documentation

The canonical documentation is maintained in a \LaTeX\ source file and
compiled to the PDF that lives next to this stub.

ðŸ‘‰  **Open `writeup/tex/README.pdf` for a fully formatted, up-to-date overview of the
project, its directory structure, and the end-to-end workflow.**

If you need to rebuild the PDF, simply run

```bash
cd writeup/tex && pdflatex -shell-escape README.tex
```

from the repository root (the command requires a standard \TeX\ Live
installation plus \texttt{pygmentize} for syntax highlighting).
